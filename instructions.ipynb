So we will only use LFS on them. Now you should run the following commands.\n",

    "This pipeline basically does what I said. To point out a few things, the testing stage will retry twice before quitting and with a 1 minite delay inbetween. This delay is included bcause something Render takes very long to deploy and a delay in render deployment shouldn't cause the pipeline to fail. I will also save the PyTest in a report.xml file so that you can view it later. To trigger the redeployment, all you have to do is send a GET request to the Deploy Hook you copied. This can be done using curl. To assess the success of PyTest, we will be utilising the status code. 0 means all tests have passed. Only in that scenario we will deploy the application, if not we will just stop the pipeline using `exit 1`. \n",
